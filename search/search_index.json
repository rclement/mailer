You should be able to display the homepage and the API documentation (e.g. https://mailer.domain.me/redoc ). If either the homepage or the API documentation do not display properly, check the logs according to your deployment method. If something feels fishy, you can always post an issue on GitHub . Serverless (e.g. Vercel) The easiest way to get started with serverless deployment is to use Vercel . You will need to create a Vercel account and to install the Vercel CLI . From the mailer codebase, create a new project on Vercel: vercel Open the project in the webapp and configure required and optional environment variables per environment (Production, Preview, Development): SENDER_EMAIL TO_EMAIL TO_NAME SMTP_HOST SMTP_PORT SMTP_TLS SMTP_SSL SMTP_USER SMTP_PASSWORD Deploy to preview environment: vercel Deploy to production environment: vercel --prod PaaS (e.g. Heroku, CleverCloud) The easiest way to get started with PaaS deployment is to use Heroku . You will need to create a Heroku account and to install the Heroku CLI . Create a project on the Heroku dashboard and add your configuration in environment variables Login to Heroku: heroku login From the mailer codebase, add the Git remote: heroku git:remote -a <my-mailer-app> Deploy: git push heroku master:master Or you can also use the containerized version! Docker The Docker image is publicly available on Docker Hub . All stable versions are automatically deployed and available after each release. The latest tag will allow to retrieve non-stable changes If you want to quickly try the Docker image: docker run --env-file .env -p 5000 :5000 rmnclmnt/mailer:latest VPS If you're feeling nerdy or a bit old-school, you are more than welcome to deploy mailer using a standard VPS from any cloud provider (AWS, OVH, etc.). We still recommend you deploy mailer using the provided Docker image for reproducibility reasons. This kind of deployment will also require some extra steps, such as setting up: A reverse-proxy link Nginx Automatic SSL/TLS certificate generation using Let's Encrypt A firewall with sensitive rules (only allow ports 80 and 443) Security policies (only allow SSH access using public key, disable root user over SSH, etc.) External intrusion protection using fail2ban etc. If you do not know (nor want to know) how to perform this kind of setup, use more developer-friendly deployment options!","title":"Deployment"},{"location":"deployment/#deployment","text":"You will need to choose: A mailing provider A cloud provider Most mailing providers offer a generous free-tier to get started ( Sendgrid , Mailjet , etc.) and allow usage via SMTP.

To run the examples properly, do not just open the .html files, but be sure to server them with a basic HTTP server, for instance: python -m http.server <port> The reason for this requirement is that if you enable CORS protection on mailer , opening files directly in a web-browser will not set the Origin header properly, thus all requests will fail.
