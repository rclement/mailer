A free and open-source software alternative to contact form services such as FormSpree,
to integrate a contact form seamlessly within your next static website!

When building static websites and [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) web applications,
the need for a contact form arises pretty often but requires some server-side processing.
`mailer` provides a dead-simple micro-service (usable as a serverless function) for this purpose,
enabling one to receive e-mails from a simple form using a single request, be it URL-encoded
or AJAX.

Proudly developed in Python using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) ASGI framework.
